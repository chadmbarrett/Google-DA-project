# Google Data Analysis Capstone Project

Date: **Thursday, July 27, 2023**

## About this project

This project explores publicly-available data about smart device (smart watch) usage for a device manufacturer. This is one of Google's standard capstone projects, so I am holding back on giving all the details of the project. However, I did include the data used for the project.

## Data analysis process

My [assignment journal](Assignment-journal.md) contains information on the source data and the BigQuery procedures I used to organize the data. My [Google DA Analyses](Google-DA-analyses.RMD) file shows how I used R to run the analyses (and where I had to stop).  To view the results of the analysis file, take a look at the html version: [Google DA Analyses](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chadmbarrett/Google-DA-project/blob/main/Google-DA-analyses.html).

## Presentation to client

The [Presentation to Bellabeat](Presentation-to-Bellabeat.ppsx) file shows the PowerPoint file I would use to make a presentation. I have one recommendation (because of my self-imposed time limit). I am sure that, given more time, I would have others.# Google-DA-capstone-project.
